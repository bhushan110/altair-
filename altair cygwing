What is Cygwin?

Cygwin is a tool that:

👉 Makes Windows behave like Linux
👉 Gives you a Linux terminal (bash) on Windows

Why Is Cygwin Used?

Some engineering tools (like Altair tools) were originally built for:

Linux

UNIX systems

So they need:

Bash shell

Linux commands

Unix-style scripts

Windows does not support these by default.

So we use Cygwin.

Why Cygwin in Altair / HyperWorks?

When you install:

Altair HyperWorks

It uses:

Shell scripts

Environment scripts

Unix commands internally

For example:

uname -r
cygcheck -V
which hwdesktop


These are Linux-style commands.

What Cygwin Helps With
1️⃣ Running Shell Scripts

Many internal scripts are:

.sh files


These need bash.

2️⃣ Build & Dev Environment

For development builds (like you installed):

dev/2026.1.0.13


Developers use:

make

gcc

bash

awk

grep

These come from Cygwin.

3️⃣ License / Environment Setup

Some license tools and environment scripts are Unix-based.

Cygwin helps run them.

Example Without Cygwin

If you run:

uname -r


In normal CMD ❌ → It won’t work.

In Cygwin ✅ → It works.

Is Cygwin Mandatory?

🟢 For normal users → Not always
🟡 For development builds → Usually yes
🔵 For internal testing → Often required

Simple Summary

Cygwin is used because:

Reason	Why
Linux Commands	Windows doesn't have them
Bash Scripts	Needed for automation
Dev Builds	Internal scripts depend on it
Compatibility	Makes Windows act like Linux
In Your Case

Since you ran:

cygcheck -V
uname -r


That means:

👉 You are verifying Cygwin environment
👉 Likely using development/internal build
